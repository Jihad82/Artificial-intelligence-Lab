# Artificial Intelligence Lab

This repository contains programs implemented in the field of Artificial Intelligence. The programs cover various algorithms and techniques commonly used in AI applications. Each program is designed to solve a specific problem or demonstrate a particular concept.

## Algorithms and Programs

The following algorithms and programs are included in this lab:

1. **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**
   - Description: This program implements the Breadth-First Search algorithm for traversing a graph or tree.
   - File: bfs.py

2. **DFS (Depth-First Search)**
   - Description: This program demonstrates the Depth-First Search algorithm for graph traversal.
   - File: dfs.py

3. **Graph Coloring**
   - Description: This program solves the graph coloring problem by assigning colors to vertices in a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
   - File: graph_coloring.py

4. **N-Queen**
   - Description: This program solves the N-Queen problem, which involves placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other.
   - File: n_queen.py

5. **Genetic Algorithm**
   - Description: This program illustrates the Genetic Algorithm, a search heuristic inspired by the process of natural selection, for solving optimization problems.
   - File: genetic_algorithm.py

6. **A* Algorithm**
   - Description: This program implements the A* (A-Star) algorithm, a popular search algorithm used in pathfinding and graph traversal problems.
   - File: a_star.py
